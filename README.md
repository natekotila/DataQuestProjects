# DataQuestProjects

These are a myriad of projects that were done through Dataquest, an online source for learning Data Science topics.

I took these projects up, because I needed a way to develop and practice my programming skills in order to supplement my Master's Degree in statistics.
Many of these files are mere snippets of code, while others are more fully developed.

Of the more developed, there are projects utilizing many skills.

## SQL

To practice using SQL, I have the chinook music repository database and the CIA Factbook database.
Of these two, chinook was more useful in displaying advance SQL querying with business sense.
